## Objective
The practical work consists of the implementation in C++, of a construction and development simulator/game (single-player), the player will be granted the concession of an island and he must develop this island, industrializing it and building a whole factory complex.

## Implementations
- The island consists of a set of zones adjacent to each other, with several possible zone types.

- The player will manage a team of workers that will include different types of workers, being able to move them around different areas of the island.
- Game action is controlled by actions that the player specifies by writing commands.
